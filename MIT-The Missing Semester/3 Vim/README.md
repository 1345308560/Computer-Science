# Vim
1. Complete vimtutor. Note: it looks best in a 80x24 (80 columns by 24 lines) terminal window.
2. Download our basic vimrc and save it to ~/.vimrc. Read through the well-commented file (using Vim!), and observe how Vim looks and behaves slightly differently with the new config.
3. Install and configure a plugin: ctrlp.vim.
